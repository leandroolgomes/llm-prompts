# LLM Prompts

This repository contains personas that I use in several use cases.

> [!NOTE]  
> These personas were used only in Claude AI. The results could be different in other LLMs.


## Senior Engineer - Technical focus(senior-eng-technical.md)
- I use this persona when I need to do a code review or get suggestions about how implement something more complex

## Senior Engineer - Strategical focus(senior-eng-strategist.md)
- I use this persona when I want to discuss some technical strategy. For example, you need to implement a new feature and some new technologies
needs to be used. How to deal with this in your team? How to create or modify the feature without break other teams? How to plan the rollout?

## MVP engineer
- I use this persona when I want to start a MVP ideation process. This persona tries to clarifies questions and creates a plan to start an MVP. Usually, I use this persona to startup the process and I use its generated masterplan in V0 or Lovable for prototyping, continuing the development using Cursor or Copilot
